<h2>How to use it</h2>
There are four conversion tables: flow/volumes and prices for the most 
common gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and helium); temperatures; and pressures.
<br>
Just click on a cell of one of the conversion tables, enter a new value, validate (by pressing the &#39;enter&#39; key) 
and all the other related cells of the table will be updated automatically.
<br>
A click on the image located in the left part of the header (the trusty HAL 9000) will bring you back to the home panel.

Main assumptions:
<ul>
  <li>Nm3 (normal cubic meter) gas measured at 1 atmosphere (1,013.25 mbar, 29.92inHg) and 0°C (32°F)</li>
  <li>Sm3 (standard cubic meter) gas measured at 1 atmosphere and 15°C (59°F)</li>
  <li>Scf (standard cubic foot) gas measured at 1 atmosphere and 70°F (21.1°C)</li>
  <li>Liquid density measured at 1 atmosphere and boiling temperature, except for CO2 measured at triple point (-56.6°C, 5.18 bar)</li>
