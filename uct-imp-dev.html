<h2>For developers</h2>
<p>
UCT is based on the Simple Web Framework. Both <a href="https://github.com/francoiscourt/uct" target="_blank">uct</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/francoiscourt/swf" target="_blank">swf</a> are available on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>User interface</h3>
<p>
No deviation from the user interface of the framework. UCT uses notably the editable table component developed espcially for this 
application: it avoids an additional form and allows for faster and easier data input.
</p>
<p>
The options for navigation are <code>hidden</code> and <code>home</code>, that is to say that the navigation
panel on the left remains hidden and that the image in the left part of the header redirects to the home panel.
</p>

<h3>Conversion</h3>
<p>
Conversions are managed in the <code>uct-main</code> javascript module. 
</p>
<p style="margin:0">
Each conversion table is represented by a <code>map object</code>, using a unique alphanumeric
identifier to represent the nature of the values to convert, for example <code>f_o2_gapd</code> for an oxygen flow in gallons per day,
<code>p_ar_mt</code> for the price of argon per metric ton or <code>pr_mbar</code> for a pressure in millibar. The unique identifier 
is associated with a <code>cvp</code> object, defined by
</p>
<ul style="margin:0"> 
	<li>a conversion factor,</li>
	<li>a format (to represent the value),</li>
	<li>a description (used in the user interface) and</li>
	<li>an optional minimun value (for temperatures).</li>
</ul>
<p>
For a given conversion map, an identifier is chosen as the reference, with a conversion factor of 1 (one) and
all the other conversion factors are calculated based on the reference. The unique id is also used in the corresponding html table to identify
each cell to update through a <code>data-id</code> attribute of the corresponding <code>td</code> element.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">
The conversion itself takes place in the <code>cvGas</code> function, with a straightforward algorithm: 
</p>
<ul style="margin-top:0">
	<li>
	for the cell being modified, a base conversion factor is calculated from the new value entered by the user and its conversion factor in the conversion map
	</li>
	<li>
	the base conversion factor is then used to update all the other cells in the table
	</li>
	<li>
	in the case of temperatures, a specific step is added to manage the offsets corresponding to the value 0 (zero)
	</li>
</ul>
