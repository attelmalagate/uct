<h2>Why another units converter?</h2>
I developed this utility on my spare time for a variety of reasons, first for fun (to each is own)
and as a practical example of my simple web framewrok, and 
second because I did not find any converter, easy to use and responsive, with all my 
most frequently-used conversions accessible in a single place (temperatures, pressures, 
prices and flows for the most common gases).

Because also <b>accurate conversions are mission-crtical</b>; there are many examples 
of failures throughout history because of a conversion mistake:
<ul>
  <li><b>Christopher Columbus</b> miscalculated the circumference of the earth 
  when he used Roman miles instead of nautical miles, which is why 
  he assumed he had hit Asia on October 12, 1492, when in fact it was the Bahamas.
  </li>
  <li>In 1983, <b>Air Canada flight 143</b> (no less than a Boeing 767) ran out of 
  fuel while cruising at an altitude of 41,000 feet with 61 passenegers on board. 
  The cause?  The crew needed to enter the fuel quantity into the flight computer 
  in kilograms, but mistakenly did the calculation with the density of jet fuel 
  in pounds/litre. It was one of Air Canada’s first planes to use metric measurements. 
  Incredibly, the pilots managed to glide the 140 tons plane over more than 20km, 
  with a dead electronic flight instrument system, to a former Royal Canadian Air 
  Force base in Gimli, Manitoba that had been converted to a motor racing track. 
  The emergency landing was susccesful with no serious injuries on the flight or 
  on the ground. Several attempts by other crews who were given the same circumstances 
  in a simulator resulted in crashes. Interestingly, years later another Canadian 
  pilot managed to safely land a comparable aircraft, an Airbus A330, after gliding 
  for 120 km: on August 24, 2001 Air Transat Flight 236 lost all engine power over 
  the Atlantic with 293 passengers and 13 crew on board, due to a fuel leak (unrelated 
  to conversion errors); only two passengers suffered serious injuries, during the 
  evacuation of the plane after the emergency landing.
  </li>
  <li>In 1994, the FAA received an anonymous tip that an American International 
  Airways (now Kalitta Air, a cargo airline) flight had landed 15 tons heavier 
  than it should have. The FAA investigated and discovered that the problem was 
  in a kilogram-to-pounds conversion (or lack thereof).
  </li>
    <li>On September 23, 1999 NASA lost the $125 million <b>Mars Climate Orbiter</b> 
	 spacecraft after a 286-day journey to Mars. Miscalculations due to the use of United 
	 States Customary Units instead of metric units sent the craft slowly off course
	 - 50 kilometers in all. Thrusters used to help point the spacecraft had, over 
	 the course of months, been fired incorrectly because Lockheed Martin, which was 
	 performing the calculations, was sending thruster data in pound-force to NASA, 
	 while NASA's navigation team was expecting metric units (newton).

  <b>Tokyo Disneyland’s Space Mountain roller coaster</b> came to a sudden halt just 
  before the end of a ride on December 5, 2003. This startling incident was due to a 
  broken axle. The axle in question fractured because it was smaller than the design’s 
  requirement; due to its incorrect size, the gap between the bearing and the axle was 
  over 1 mm – when it should have been a mere 0.2 mm. The accumulation of excess vibration 
  and stress eventually caused it to break. Though the coaster derailed, there were no 
  injuries. Once again, unit systems caused the accident: in September 1995, the 
  specifications for the coaster’s axles and bearings were changed to metric units. 
  In August 2002, however, the British-Imperial-unit plans prior to 1995 were used 
  to order 44.14 mm axles instead of the needed 45 mm axles.

  <li>There are numerous examples reported by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices 
  of patients receiving the wrong dose of medication due to the <b>confusion of 
  grams and grains</b> (a grain weighs about 0.065 grams). 
  </li>
</ul>
